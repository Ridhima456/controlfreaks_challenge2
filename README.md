# Bot Detection System

## Team: Ctrl Freaks

### Overview
This project aims to detect social media bots that spread misinformation, spam content, and manipulate discussions. The system analyzes user activity and social media content using machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate between human users and automated accounts. The solution is scalable, efficient, and adaptable to different social media bot behaviors.

## Features
### Bot Detection Mechanism
- Uses content patterns, sentiment analysis, and linguistic features to detect bots.
- Identifies anomalies in user activity such as excessive automation, repeated content, and unnatural engagement.
- Provides a confidence score for each account's likelihood of being a bot.

### Scalability and Performance
- Supports real-time analysis of thousands of social media posts.
- Ensures efficient processing of large-scale data.

### Detection Reports and Insights
- Generates structured outputs summarizing detection results.
- Provides insights into bot activity trends and behaviors.

## Implementation Details
### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  
  - **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy  
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, xgboost  
  - **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn  

### Dataset
- The dataset consists of social media posts labeled as bots or human-generated content.
- Features extracted include:  
  - **Text-based Features**: Word embeddings, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF.
  - **Behavioral Features**: Posting frequency, hashtag usage, engagement metrics.

### Model Architecture
#### Machine Learning Models
1. **Random Forest Classifier**: Baseline model for bot detection.
2. **XGBoost Classifier**: Improved accuracy over Random Forest.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost transformers
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ridhima456/controlfreaks_challenge2
```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
```bash
cd bot-detection
```
3. Run the bot detection script: 
```bash
python bot_detection.py
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Detection Accuracy**:  
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC.
- **Scalability and Performance**:  
  - Processing speed and real-time detection capability.
- **Interpretability of Results**:  
  - Clarity in bot classification reports.

## Results
- The **Random Forest model** achieved **51% accuracy**.
- The **XGBoost model** improved performance to **50% accuracy**.

## Future Enhancements
- Improving detection of human-like bots using advanced NLP techniques.
- Integrating graph-based analysis for bot networks.
- Real-time API implementation for live monitoring of social media.
